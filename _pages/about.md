<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/)  at [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), where I am fortunate to have [Arkady Yerukhimovich](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~arkady/) as my advisor. Previously, I have received MS in Systems Engineering in 2024 from [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical and applied Cryptography, with recent work on Distributed Point Functions, Functional Encryption, Content Moderation in E2E Messaging Services and Private Set Intersection.
